-> Variability in findings across studies can be uniquely troubling when replications are conducted. 
Because replications are often used to assess the trustworthiness of an effect (e.g., Open Science Collaboration [11]), 
if an effect cannot be replicated, the finding, and sometimes the associated researchers, may be viewed as questionable.
As a result, a replication being interpreted as a success or a failure can have severe consequences for the area of study and perceptions of the researchers’
integrity [12–13]. However, a problem with interpreting replications is that single studies, even if competently executed and properly analyzed, 
are inherently imperfect pieces of information
