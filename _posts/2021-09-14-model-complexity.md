> While the goal of mathematical modeling in cognitive psychology is to select one
model from a set of competing models that best captures the underlying mental
process, the researcher often chooses the model that best fits a particular set of
data. Presumably, the justification for this procedure is that the model providing
the best fit (e.g., the one that accounts for the most variance) is the one that most
closely approximates the underlying mental process. In fact, this justification is
unwarranted, for a highly complex model can provide a good fit without necessarily
bearing any interpretable relationship with the underlying process

> Complexity affects not only model fit but also the generalizability of a model and
the variability in parameter estimation. It is therefore necessary to consider them
when evaluating models. A simple model will generalize better to new data sets than
a complex model and thus will have a higher degree of predictive accuracy. In addition, a simple model's behavior is more tractable because parameter estimates will
be more stable after repeated data fittings than those of complex models.

> Understanding the complexity of a deep model is a key
to precisely understanding the capability and limitation of the model. Exploring
model complexity is necessary not only for understanding a deep model itself,
but also for investigating many other related fundamental questions. For example, from the statistical learning theory point of view, the expressive power of a
model is used to bound the generalization error [69]. Some recent studies propose norm-based model complexity [60] and sensitivity-based model complexity [76, 81] to explore the generalization capability of deep models. Moreover,
detecting changes of model complexity in a training process can provide insights
into understanding and improving the performance of model optimization and
regularization [44, 74, 89].
