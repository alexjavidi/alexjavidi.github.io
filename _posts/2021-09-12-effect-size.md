Effect size is one of the most importat outcomes of an empirical study. It is always good to go back to the library, and read some books or papers. Beacuse there is a good chance that you can find good stuff from world-class experts. Hisotry is the best teacher!

Here are some qoutes that shed some light on the importance of effect size:
> ‘Effect size’ is simply a way of quantifying the size of the difference between 
two groups. It is easy to calculate, readily understood and can be applied to any 
measured outcome in Education or Social Science. It is particularly valuable for
quantifying the effectiveness of a particular intervention, relative to some comparison.
It allows us to move beyond the simplistic, ‘Does it work or not?’ to the far more 
sophisticated, ‘How well does it work in a range of contexts?’ Moreover, by placing 
the emphasis on the most important aspect of an intervention – the size of the effect – 
rather than its statistical significance (which conflates effect size and sample size), it 
promotes a more scientific approach to the accumulation of knowledge. For these 
reasons, effect size is an important tool in reporting and interpreting effectiveness.

> Statistical significance is the least interesting thing about the results. You should describe the results in terms of measures of magnitude—not just, does a treatment affect people, but how much does it affect them.

> I have learned and taught that the primary product of a research inquiry is one or more measures of effect size, not p values. Effect-size measures include mean differences (raw or standardized), correlations and squared correlation of all kinds, odds ratios, kappas-whatever conveys the magnitude of the phenomenon of interest appropriate to the reseach context.

> Effect sizes are the most important outcome of empirical studies. Most articles on effect sizes highlight their importance to communicate the practical significance of results. For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies.
